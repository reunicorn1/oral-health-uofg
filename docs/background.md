# Background of The Study

## Assessing oral health in healthcare students

Good oral health is a crucial component of overall human wellness. According to the World Health Organization, oral health means having a mouth and face that are free from ongoing pain, cancers of the mouth and throat, infections, ulcers, gum disease, cavities, missing teeth, and any other conditions that interfere with a person's ability to bite, chew, smile, speak, or maintain psychological and social well-being [(14)](https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/oral-health). The condition of our oral health has direct impacts on our general health, plays a role in health disparities, and represents a significant aspect of medical care that spans multiple healthcare fields and specialties.

The assessment of oral health knowledge, behavior, and status among dental and medical students holds critical importance for several reasons. Healthcare students, particularly those in dental and medical programs, serve as future health professionals who will guide public oral health promotion and act as role models for patients and communities [(1)](https://www.dovepress.com/oral-health-knowledge-attitude-and-behavior-among-health-professions-s-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCIDE). It is of paramount importance that their own knowledge pertaining to oral health is accurate and their oral hygiene practice conforms to the expectations of the community.

## Regional Disparities of Oral Health Outcomes

While specific comparative data between Gezira State and Khartoum regarding oral health outcomes remains limited in the available literature, several studies provide insights into Sudanese oral health patterns and regional variations.

The University of Gezira, established in 1975, is a non-profit public higher education institution located in the urban center of Wad Medani, Sudan. It ranks among the top universities in Sudan as of 2024  [(10)](link). The university is situated near the Gezira Project, one of Africa’s largest agricultural initiatives, historically vital to the Sudanese economy  [(11)](link).

The institution enrolls approximately 22,500 students, drawing from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds spanning urban (Wad Medani), peri-urban (Umra-Qura), and rural (Medina Arab) localities  [(12)](link). As a public university with an acceptance rate of 81%  [(13)](link), it serves a broad demographic, many of whom may face financial constraints and limited access to healthcare services. Research in the region highlights healthcare access challenges, particularly among farmers, whose income often falls short of medical expenses  [(source)](link). This diversity in socioeconomic status and healthcare access shapes the experiences and health behaviors of the university’s student population.
