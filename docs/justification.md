# Justification

University of Gezira's geographical and institutional context as a public funded university creates several unique factors that justify targeted research. The diversity of the Gezira state also provides an ideal natural laboratory to examine how different socioeconomic conditions influence oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices.

Research indicates that farmers in the Gezira scheme do not get enough health care whereas income from agricultural production is less than medical treatment expenses for most farmers. This economic reality means that many students at the University of Gezira come from families where healthcare access is limited, potentially influencing their own oral health experiences and knowledge base.

> **Suggestions for more elaborate justification:**
>
> - Oral health knowledge and behavior is influenced by culture and community. In the Sudanese context, particularly in Gezira, several factors may contribute to that like traditional oral hygiene practices, cultural beliefs about dental treatment. (A deeper dive into this part will give a better holistic context)
> - Medical curricula lack integrated oral health components, and this is scientifically known and already backed up by research  [(15)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35733361/). To strengthen the justification for studying medical students despite expected lower knowledge levels, consider these angles: They serve as first points of contact in healthcare systems, they influence patient health behaviors through their recommendations, and in resource-limited settings like Sudan, they may be the only healthcare providers patients encounter.
> - Even if medical students are expected to have lower oral health knowledge than dental students, this doesn't diminish the research value because: quantifying the knowledge gap could identify specific educational needs, understanding the disparity can inform curriculum development, and finally the study can identify which aspects of oral health knowledge is lacking within medical students knowledge.
