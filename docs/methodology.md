# Subjects and Methods

## Study design

To test these hypotheses and achieve the stated objectives, a cross-sectional design was selected because it allows for simultaneous assessment of knowledge, behavior, and oral health status across different student groups  **at a single point in time**, enabling efficient comparison between specialties and academic levels while providing a comprehensive snapshot of current oral health patterns among healthcare students at University of Gezira.

## Study Population

Dental and Medical students serve as future health professionals who will guide public oral health promotion and act as role models for patients and communities.

Academic Year Selection (1st, 3rd, 5th) is based on the following:

- **1st year students:** Represent baseline knowledge and behaviors before significant exposure to health sciences curriculum
- **3rd year students:** Mid-curriculum exposure - students have received theoretical knowledge but limited clinical experience
- **5th year students:** Near-completion of program with maximum theoretical knowledge and clinical exposure

Both dental and medical programs follow similar progression patterns. Literature shows that "third-year students show significantly better oral health attitudes and behaviors compared to first-year students". This supports examining progression across these specific years.

## Sampling Technique

Self-selection sampling technique was selected because it ensures voluntary, informed participation essential for clinical examinations and honest behavioral reporting, overcomes logistical challenges of accessing students across multiple academic years and faculties, and aligns with ethical principles of autonomous participation. While this approach may limit generalizability, it provides high-quality data from motivated participants and is appropriate for exploratory research establishing baseline patterns in this previously unstudied population.

## Sampling Size

To calculate sample size in such a complex study that measure multiple variables. We focus on one specific goal:  **Oral Health Status (Self-reported good oral health)**

Why?: Most clinically meaningful, easiest to interpret, aligns with the main research question.

Based on the Chinese study that is a major reference for this research.

_**Oral Health Status (Primary Outcome)**_

- **Dental students:** 23.8% reported good oral health → p1 = 0.238
- **Medical students:** 11.4% reported good oral health → p2 = 0.114

_**Secondary Outcomes for Validation:**_

- **Proper brushing technique (3rd year):**
  - Dental: 66.3% use correct technique
  - Medical: <50% use correct technique
- **Regular dental visits:**
  - Dental: 19.9% visit regularly
  - Medical: Lower (specific % not given, assume ~10%)

### Multiple Group Design

**2 specialties × 3 years × 2 genders = 12 subgroups**
**Minimum per subgroup:** 147 ÷ 6 = ~25 per cell
**Recommended:** 30-40 per cell for reliable analysis
**Total needed:** 12 × 35 = 420 students

Sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome of self-reported oral health status. Based on literature evidence showing 23.8% of dental students vs 11.4% of medical students report good oral health (12.4 percentage point difference), and using a two-sample proportion test with 80% power and 95% confidence level,  **147 participants per specialty group were required.**

To accommodate multiple comparisons across specialties, academic levels, and gender, and ensure adequate representation in each subgroup (2 specialties × 3 academic years × 2 genders = 12 subgroups), a total sample size of 420 participants was determined (35 per subgroup). This sample size provides adequate power to detect clinically meaningful differences in both primary and secondary outcomes.
