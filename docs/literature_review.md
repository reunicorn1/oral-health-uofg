# Literature Review

While studies have shown that educational interventions based on the KAP (knowledge-attitude-practice) paradigm greatly improved oral health practice, a positive correlation between low knowledge and the prevalence of dental caries was observed [(1)](https://www.dovepress.com/oral-health-knowledge-attitude-and-behavior-among-health-professions-s-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCIDE).

## Regional Disparities of Oral Health Outcomes

While specific comparative data between Gezira State and Khartoum regarding oral health outcomes remains limited in the available literature, several studies provide insights into Sudanese oral health patterns and regional variations.

Research conducted in Khartoum reveals concerning oral health statistics. A comprehensive survey of Sudanese adults in Khartoum State found that 87.7% of examined teeth had untreated decay, with periodontal disease increasing in extent and severity with age  [(2)](https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6831-12-5). Among adolescents attending high schools in Khartoum, dental caries prevalence reached 91.1%, with a mean DMFT of 3.3 (± 1.8)  [(3)](https://www.ceghonline.com/article/S2213-3984(22)00122-1/fulltext).

Studies of dental students in Khartoum indicate variations between public and private institutions. Research involving 642 dental students from six dental faculties in Khartoum showed that students attending privately funded schools were more knowledgeable about various HIV-related issues than students from publicly funded schools  [(4)](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/15222). This suggests potential disparities in educational quality and resources that may extend to oral health education.

## Evidence-based Hypothesis Formation

The literature provides numerous statistical benchmarks that can inform expectation calculations for oral health studies among university students.

### Oral Health Knowledge Metrics

Studies report varying levels of oral health knowledge among healthcare students. Research involving 496 dental and medical students found that 91% were aware of the significance of routine dental visits, while 51.3% reported visiting dentists when experiencing pain  [(1)](https://www.dovepress.com/oral-health-knowledge-attitude-and-behavior-among-health-professions-s-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCIDE)  . This indicates  **high percentage**  of knowledge among students. Knowledge scores using the Hiroshima University Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI) among medical students averaged 5.62, indicating moderate oral health attitudes  [(6)](https://stm.bookpi.org/RUDHR-V3/article/view/13551).

### Behavioral Patterns and Prevalence Rates

Tooth brushing frequency serves as a key behavioral indicator. Studies show that 44.5% of students brush twice daily, 41.3% once daily, and 9.31% more than twice daily  [(1)](https://www.dovepress.com/oral-health-knowledge-attitude-and-behavior-among-health-professions-s-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCIDE). A Chinese study shows that dental freshmen slightly outperformed medical peers in brushing techniques and recognizing the oral-systemic disease link. Notably, Senior dental students demonstrated significant improvements in brushing frequency, technique, and use of floss or mouthwash [(7)](https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-019-0716-6)
.

### Oral Health Status Indicators

Clinical assessments reveal significant variations in oral health status. A Chinese study of dental and medical students found that only 17.2% of junior students had good oral health, including 23.8% of dental students and 11.4% of medical students [(7)](https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-019-0716-6).

The literature consistently demonstrates a positive correlation between oral health knowledge and behavior  [(5)](https://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201632747976698.page) . Studies show that oral health knowledge significantly affects smoking status (β=-0.200, p<0.001), dietary control practice (β=-0.123, p<0.05), and daily toothbrushing frequency (β=-0.240, p<0.001)  [(5)](https://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201632747976698.page).

Evidence suggests that higher educational levels and clinical exposure improve oral health knowledge and behaviors. Therefore it’s expected that dental students will show higher percentages in knowledge and as a result behavior and practice as well. Research demonstrates that third-year students show significantly better oral health attitudes and behaviors compared to first-year students, particularly regarding gingival health and oral hygiene practices  [(6)](https://stm.bookpi.org/RUDHR-V3/article/view/13551).

## **Key Risk Factors and Determinants**

The literature identifies several critical risk factors and determinants affecting oral health among university students.

### Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors

Age, gender, and socioeconomic status emerge as significant determinants. Studies show that females demonstrate better oral health behaviors than males, with mean oral health knowledge scores of 8.1 ± 1.8 for females compared to 7.2 ± 2.1 for males  [(8)](https://www.dovepress.com/oral-health-knowledge-attitudes-and-behaviors-among-university-student-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCIDE). Educational background and family socioeconomic status also influence oral health outcomes  [(9)](https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7525-8-152).

### Behavioral Risk Factors

Poor oral hygiene practices represent the primary modifiable risk factor. Research indicates that behavior is the most dominant factor influencing dental caries rates [(9)](https://ejournal.medistra.ac.id/index.php/JKG/article/view/2245).

### Knowledge and Attitude Deficits

Insufficient oral health knowledge serves as a fundamental risk factor. Studies reveal that only 25.1% of medical students knew about bacterial plaque, and only 42.7% could identify sucrose as a cariogenic factor  [(7)](https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-019-0716-6). These knowledge gaps translate into poor preventive behaviors and increased disease risk.
