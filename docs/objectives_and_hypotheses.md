# Objectives & Hypothesis

## General Objective

Based on the identified gaps, this study aims to assess oral health knowledge, behavior, and clinical status among dental and medical students at University of Gezira, 2023

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Assessment Objectives (Descriptive)

- [x]  1.1. **To evaluate the current level of oral health knowledge** among dental and medical students using validated assessment tools.
- [x]  1.2. **To assess oral health behaviors and practices** including brushing frequency, flossing habits, dietary patterns, and preventive care utilization.
- [x]  1.3. **To determine the prevalence and severity of oral health problems** through clinical examination and self-reported conditions.

### 2. Comparative Analysis Objectives (Analytical)

- [x]  2.1. **To compare oral health knowledge, behavior, and status between dental and medical students** and quantify the magnitude of differences.
- [x]  2.2. **To analyze the progression of oral health knowledge, behavior, and status across academic levels** (1st, 3rd, and 5th year students).
- [x]  2.3. **To examine gender-based differences in oral health knowledge, behavior, and status** between male and female students.
- [x]  2.4. **To assess the interaction effects between specialty, academic level, and gender** on oral health outcomes.

### 3. Relationship and Correlation Objectives (Analytical)

- [ ]  3.1. **To determine the correlation between oral health knowledge and actual oral health behaviors** among study participants.
- [ ]  3.2. **To evaluate the relationship between reported behaviors and actual oral health status** as measured by clinical indicators.

## Research Hypotheses

Given the literature evidence presented, we hypothesize based on the objectives of the study that:

## Primary Hypotheses (Based on Main Objectives)

### Hypothesis 1: Knowledge Assessment

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health knowledge scores between dental and medical students at University of Gezira.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Dental students have significantly higher oral health knowledge scores compared to medical students at University of Gezira.

**Evidence-based justification:** Literature shows **dental students** typically demonstrate superior oral health knowledge due to specialized curriculum. Studies indicate dental students outperform medical peers in recognizing oral-systemic disease links and preventive practices.

### Hypothesis 2: Behavioral Assessment

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health behaviors between dental and medical students at University of Gezira.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Dental students demonstrate significantly better oral health behaviors compared to medical students at University of Gezira.

**Evidence-based justification:** Research demonstrates that **dental students** show improved brushing frequency, technique, and use of floss/mouthwash compared to medical students.

### Hypothesis 3: Oral Health Status

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health status between dental and medical students at University of Gezira.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Dental students have significantly better oral health status compared to medical students at University of Gezira.

**Evidence-based justification:** Studies show dental students have better oral health outcomes, with 23.8% having good oral health compared to 11.4% of medical students.

## Secondary Hypotheses (Academic Level Comparison)

### Hypothesis 4: Knowledge by Academic Level

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health knowledge among 1st, 3rd, and 5th year students.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Senior students (5th year) have significantly higher oral health knowledge compared to junior students (1st and 3rd year).

**Evidence-based justification:** Literature consistently shows that higher educational levels and clinical exposure improve oral health knowledge, with third-year students showing significantly better attitudes than first-year students.

### Hypothesis 5: Behavior by Academic Level

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health behaviors among 1st, 3rd, and 5th year students.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Senior students demonstrate significantly better oral health behaviors compared to junior students.

### Hypothesis 6: Status by Academic Level

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in oral health status among 1st, 3rd, and 5th year students.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Senior students have significantly better oral health status compared to junior students.

### Hypothesis 6: Status by Gender

**H₀ (Null):** There is no significant difference in genders.

**H₁ (Alternative):** Female students have significantly better oral health status compared to male students.
