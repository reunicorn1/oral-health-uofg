- **processed/**: Contains cleaned and transformed datasets ready for analysis, such as:
  - `oral-health-uofg-cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the raw data.
  - `knowledge_scores.csv`: Knowledge scores calculated from survey responses.
  - `knowledge_behavior_status_scores.csv`: Combined scores for knowledge, behavior, and oral health status.
