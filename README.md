# 🦷 Oral Health Research Among Healthcare Students – University of Gezira

This repository documents an academic research project investigating oral health knowledge, behaviors, and clinical status among dental and medical students at the University of Gezira, Sudan.

## 📚 Overview

Oral health is a fundamental component of overall health and quality of life. Healthcare students—especially future doctors and dentists—play a critical role in promoting public oral health. This study explores how factors such as **specialty, academic year, and gender** influence oral health outcomes.

By focusing on the University of Gezira, a public university serving a socioeconomically diverse population, this research aims to provide evidence-based insights relevant to oral health education and policy development in resource-constrained settings.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assess oral health **knowledge**, **behavior**, and **clinical status** among medical and dental students.
- Compare oral health indicators across:
  - Specialties (Medicine vs. Dentistry)
  - Academic levels (1st, 3rd, and 5th year)
  - Gender (Male vs. Female)
- Identify correlations between knowledge, behavior, and clinical outcomes.
