## Usage

These notebooks are intended for reproducible research and can be run sequentially to follow the data analysis workflow. They rely on data files in the `data/processed` directory and produce figures and tables found in the `results/figures` and `results/tables` folders.

For more details on the methodology and findings, refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder.
