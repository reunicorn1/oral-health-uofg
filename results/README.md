# Results & Conclusions

## Key Findings and Hypothesis Testing

| Topic | Null Hypothesis (H₀) | Result | Rejected? | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Knowledge (Faculty)** | No significant difference in oral health knowledge between dental & medical students. | Slight advantage for dental students but not statistically significant. | ❌ | Chi-square per question: inconsistent; aggregated score: small effect size. |
| **Knowledge (Academic Level)** | No significant difference among 1st, 3rd, and 5th years. | No consistent trend; p-values not significant. | ❌ | Largest gap in 4th year but high variability. |
| **Knowledge (Gender)** | No significant difference between male & female students. | Distributions overlapped heavily. | ❌ | Gender not a meaningful predictor. |
| **Behavior (Faculty)** | No significant difference in oral health behaviors between dental & medical students. | Dental students scored ~85%, medical ~67%. | ✅ | Statistically significant; confirmed by Fisher’s exact test and ANOVA. |
| **Behavior (Academic Level)** | No significant difference among 1st, 3rd, and 5th years. | p > 0.05 | ❌ | Slight differences but not statistically robust. |
| **Behavior (Gender)** | No significant difference between male & female students. | Statistically significant but small effect size (8% variance explained). | ✅ (practically modest) | |
| **Oral Health Status (Faculty)** | No significant difference between dental & medical students. | No significant difference despite dental students’ better behaviors. | ❌ | Possible sample imbalance & variability. |
| **Oral Health Status (Academic Level)** | No significant difference among 1st, 3rd, and 5th years. | No consistent pattern. | ❌ | |
| **Oral Health Status (Gender)** | No significant difference between genders. | No significant difference. | ❌ | |

## Summary Interpretation

### **Knowledge Analysis**

- Dental students scored slightly higher than medical students in overall oral health knowledge.
- Differences were **not statistically significant**, indicating that both faculties have comparable levels of theoretical understanding.
- Year-by-year analysis showed no consistent pattern, although 4th-year dental students stood out slightly.
- Gender was not a predictor of knowledge score.
- **Interpretation:** Knowledge gaps are minimal between faculties — curriculum differences don’t translate into large measurable knowledge advantages for dental students.

### **Behavior Analysis**

- Dental students exhibited **significantly better oral health behaviors** than medical students (85% vs. 67% adherence to positive behaviors).
- This difference held up in aggregated scoring and ANOVA testing, even after accounting for academic level.
- Academic year differences were not statistically significant.
- Gender differences were statistically significant but practically small.
- **Interpretation:** Education in dentistry appears to influence daily habits and preventive care behaviors more than medical training does.

### **Oral Health Status**

- Despite better behaviors, dental students did **not** have significantly better oral health status than medical students.
- No statistical differences were found across academic levels or genders.
- Possible reasons: self-report bias, other lifestyle factors, or insufficient sample power.
- **Interpretation:** Better behaviors don’t necessarily translate into measurable differences in self-reported oral health status within this sample.

## Limitations

- **Sample imbalance** – 85% medicine vs. 15% dentistry; gender skewed toward females (76%).
- **Small subgroup sizes** – Reduced statistical power in year-by-year and faculty-by-year breakdowns.
- **Cross-sectional design** – Cannot infer causality.
- **Self-reported data** – Potential recall and social desirability bias.
